            <H2><strong>ShareVR Unity Plugin v0.2 Release</strong></H2>
            <p>Welcome to ShareVR Unity SDK v0.2 release. There are few exciting improvements we made over the last week and we are really eager to share them with you!</p>
            <p><strong>What's New in SDK 0.2?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Voice Command</strong>&nbsp;- Having trouble deciding which key should you map to our control? Well, time to say good bye to keys. In SDK v0.2, we have configured a voice command system powered by IBM Watson Cloud Service. Simply check&nbsp;<em>Use Voice Command</em>&nbsp;and speak. Below are a list of available voice commands:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>[Start Recording]</em>&nbsp;- Starts a new recording</li>
                    <li><em>[Stop Recording]</em>&nbsp;- Ends an active recording</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Significantly reduced render cost during recording</strong>&nbsp;- We spotted a bug in SDK v0.1 that trigger a catastrophic&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/shawnhar/2008/04/14/stalling-the-pipeline/">pipline stall</a>&nbsp;during recording. Fixing this bug allows us to improve the recording performance by a stunning&nbsp;<strong>~70%</strong>&nbsp;(more details below)!</li>
                <li><strong>Significantly improved frame rate performance</strong>&nbsp;- No more fluctuating frame rates while recording! Now the frame rate will stay stabilized without big spikes in the rendering time will usually cause jitter in VR.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Profiling Data</strong></p>
            <p>Below are detailed Unity Profiling results. We tested SDK v0.1 and v0.2 on a normal HD recording setting (720p@30FPS) in SteamVR's interaction system example scene.</p>
            <p><strong>Improved Rendering Time</strong></p>
            <p>With the help of the powerful Unity Profiler, we can easily estimate the additional rendering time that our plugin used during recording. We measured the baseline rendering time with ShareVR in standby mode (<em>not recording</em>). In this case, the rendering time are mostly the time it takes to render the game scene itself. We then measured the worst possible rendering length after initialization (<em>the first few large spikes</em>). With calculating the difference between these two measurements, we now have a good estimate of how much additional rendering time does our ShareVR plugin added while recording.</p>
            <p>We observed our rendering time during recording dropped from&nbsp;<em>13.67ms</em>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<em>4.20ms</em>&nbsp;which gives us an estimated performance gain of&nbsp;<strong>~69.28%</strong>. Note that this data is taken at the&nbsp;<em>worst possible spot</em>&nbsp;which means that the averaged rendering time that ShareVR need during recording will be below&nbsp;<em>4.20ms</em>.</p>
            <p><strong>Stabilized Frame Rate</strong></p>
            <p>In addition to rendering time improvement, it's also obvious that the frame rate is now way more stable than SDK v0.1. The main reason behind that is the pipline stall problem. In SDK v0.1 our recording coroutine will cause pipline stall which forces CPU and GPU to sync event with each other. It's costly operation that will lead to significantly increased rendering time. After our fix, the CPU-GPU sync will be managed by SteamVR and Unity which delivers a smooth frame rate.</p>

            <h2><br /> <br /> ShareVR Unity Plugin v0.1</h2>
            <p>Welcome to ShareVR Unity SDK v0.1. Thanks for taking time trying out our plugin. The quick start tutorial will help you quickly setup our plugin. If you have any question, please don't hesitate to contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:team@sharevr.io">team@sharevr.io</a></p>
            <p><strong>Getting Started</strong></p>
            <p><em>ShareVR requires the SteamVR plugin loaded in your project</em></p>
            <p><strong>Import ShareVR and Load the Example Scene</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Make sure you have SteamVR plugin in your project</li>
                <li>Import the ShareVR Unity Plugin (currently distributed as a separate UnityPackage)</li>
                <li>Under Assets/ShareVR/Scenes/ open the example scene</li>
                <li>Hit play then you should be able to start testing</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>By default, the recording can be started and stopped by pressing the X key in your keyboard. We provided other mapping options including some that use the Vive Controllers. You can change them in the ShareVR gameobject.</li>
                    <li><strong>Press X key to start record</strong>. Once you started recording, a ShareVRCameraRig game object will be instantiated with a visible camera model (you can toggle the model display on/off and change the scale of the model in the ShareVR gameobject). You should be able to see the camera started following you and the little green light on the camera indicates it's recording now.</li>
                    <li>Feel free to move around and teleport. The ShareVRCameraRig smoothly follows you as you move.</li>
                    <li><strong>Press X again to stop recording</strong>. A video file will be created in the "ShareVR" folder under current Windows user's Documents folder.</li>
                    <li>You can record as many times as you want and each session will create a separate video file.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Apply ShareVR to Your Own Game</strong></p>
            <p>Our goal is make our ShareVR Unity plugin easy-to-use yet still adaptive and customizable so that it could fit well in to your own application. Here's an example of how apply ShareVR to the SteamVR InteractionSystem example scene.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Open SteamVR interaction system example scene located at: Assets/SteamVR/InteractionSystem/Samples/Scenes/Interactions_Example</li>
                <li>To use ShareVR, you just need to proceed with the two step below.</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Under Assets/ShareVR/Prefabs/, drag the ShareVR gameobject to anywhere in the scene hierarchy.</li>
                    <li>Click the ShareVR gameobject in the scene hierarchy. Reference the target gameobject that you want the spectator camera to track and record by draging the target gameobject into "Player Head Game Object".</li>
                    <li>(optional) If you are using the avatar ("ShareVR/Show Player Avatar" checked), you need to make sure the main camera ignores the avatar so that the avatar body won't occludes with your main camera. Simply find your main camera (in the InteractionSystem example, it's located at Player/SteamVRObjects/VRCamera) and uncheck "IgnoreInMainCamera" in the Culling Mask list.</li>
                </ol>
                <li>Now you are done with the quick setup. Hit play and you should be able to record just like our example scene.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Note that We have some additional options listed below if you want to customize the plugin to better fit into your game. We kept all the available options in the ShareVR gameobject to make it easier to find. Below are the available options with description:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Show Camera Model</em>&nbsp;- toggles whether or not a 3D model of the recording camera will be shown. Useful if you want to see where the camera is.</li>
                <li><em>Camera Model Scale</em>&nbsp;- If you are using the camera model, this adjusts the scale of the model so it won't be too small or big.</li>
                <li><em>Show Player Avatar</em>&nbsp;- toggles whether or not a player avatar will be shown in the scene. We currently have a generic free avatar for you to use if you don't have an avatar for the player. Note that you can easily replace it to any 3D model you like. Please contact us if you have any specific need for the avatar.</li>
                <li><em>Avatar Scale</em>&nbsp;- adjusts the scale of the avatar</li>
                <li><em>Avatar Offset</em>&nbsp;- adjusts the offset between the avatar to your main player (the Player Head Game Object). Change this if the avatar appears to be off.</li>
                <li><em>Toggle Recording Input</em>&nbsp;- use this to change your desired key mapping that triggers the start / stop recording event.</li>
                <li><em>Player Head Game Object</em>&nbsp;- reference your main target gameobject here and the ShareVRCameraRig will track and record it. You cannot leave this empty as it will cause error.</li>
                <li><em>Player Hand Transforms</em>&nbsp;- (optional) if you are using the avatar and would like the hand of the avatar to track your Vive Controllers, reference your hand gameobject here otherwise it's fine to leave it blank.</li>
                <li><em>Show Debug Message</em>&nbsp;- use this to track the status of the plugin. Debug messages will be shown in your Unity Editor Console</li>
                <li><em>ShareVR Video Format</em>&nbsp;- change it if you want to record with a different resolution or frame rate. The default is 960x540 at 30 FPS to balance between video quality and performance. We are working hard optimizing our infrastructure to reduce performance cost.</li>
            </ul>
